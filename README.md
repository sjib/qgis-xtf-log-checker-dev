# XTFLog-Checker

## What do I use XTFLog-Checker for?
XTFLog-Checker is a [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) plugin that lets you display errors in XTFLog files created by the [Ilivalidator](https://www.interlis.ch/downloads/ilivalidator) and [iG/Check](https://www.interlis.ch/en/downloads/igcheck). When opening an XTFLog file in QGIS with this plugin, a checklist is created that helps you keep track of your progress when addressing the errors.

## Where can I get it?
Install the [QGIS XTFLog-Checker](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins) directly in QGIS by using the [Plugins menu](http://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins.html).

## Qt6 supported
Beginning with version 1.30, Qt6 support has been added. The plugin is now compatible with both Qt5 and Qt6 builds of QGIS.
As QGIS based on Qt6 is still in its early testing phase, some bugs may occur.
Please report any problems you experience by submitting an issue.

## Requirements
- QGIS version: 3.40 or later
- Tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux
